# 🏗️ **Initial Project Setup — MLOps Weather Prediction**

This branch establishes the **foundational structure** for the **MLOps Weather Prediction** project.
It sets up a **modular Python codebase** under `src/`, configures dependency management with **`uv`**, and prepares the repository for the first workflow stage — **`01_data_preparation`**, which will handle data ingestion, feature engineering, and model training for **weather forecasting and temperature prediction**.

## ⚙️ **Setup Process**

The following steps describe how the base environment and folder structure were created.

### 1️⃣ Create the Project Structure

Directories were organised to separate **core logic**, **pipeline workflows**, and **data artefacts**, ensuring modularity and long-term maintainability.

```bash
mkdir -p artifacts/raw pipeline src templates static
touch src/__init__.py
```

Two essential modules were created inside `src/`:

* `custom_exception.py` — Provides structured, contextual error handling for consistent debugging across the pipeline.
* `logger.py` — Implements a unified, timestamped logging system for reproducibility and traceability.

### 2️⃣ Create and Activate the Virtual Environment (with `uv`)

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a **lightning-fast Python package manager** ideal for reproducible MLOps setups.

Create a Python 3.12 virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

Activate the environment:

* **Windows (cmd):**

  ```cmd
  .\.venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **PowerShell:**

  ```powershell
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```
* **macOS / Linux:**

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

Once active, `(.venv)` will appear in your terminal prompt.

### 3️⃣ Define and Install Dependencies

A lightweight `requirements.txt` was created to support early data processing and modelling:

```text
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

Install all dependencies and generate a lock file for reproducibility:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv lock
```

### 4️⃣ Define Project Metadata

A `pyproject.toml` file provides a single source of truth for project metadata and dependency management.

```toml
[project]
name = "mlops-weather-prediction"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An MLOps pipeline for forecasting and predicting weather conditions using machine learning."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = []
```

The generated `uv.lock` file ensures consistent dependency versions across environments.

### 5️⃣ Install the Project in Editable Mode

To apply code changes instantly without reinstalling the package, install the project **in editable mode**:

```bash
uv pip install --editable .
```

You should see confirmation similar to:

```
Built mlops-weather-prediction @ file:///C:/Users/HP/Documents/Projects/MLOps/MLOps-Weather-Prediction
Installed 1 package in 14ms
 + mlops-weather-prediction==0.1.0
```

This ensures changes in `src/` are reflected dynamically throughout the project.

## 🧩 Integration Guidelines

| Folder           | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/`           | Core utilities for logging, error handling, and shared functions.    |
| `pipeline/`      | Workflow orchestration for data ingestion, training, and evaluation. |
| `artifacts/raw/` | Source datasets and early-stage data artefacts.                      |
| `static/`        | Generated plots or visual outputs.                                   |
| `templates/`     | HTML templates for any future web interface (Flask/Streamlit).       |

✅ **In summary:**

This setup provides a **clean, modular foundation** for the **MLOps Weather Prediction** project —
featuring reproducible dependency management via `uv`, robust logging and error handling utilities, and a scalable layout ready to evolve into a **complete Kubeflow-integrated MLOps workflow**.
